      <h3>Square Cash - Main Screens</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cash.me/" target="_blank">Square Cash</a> is a payment service and mobile application offered by Square, Inc. for both business and personal use. The main mobile screen is extremely clean and simple:</p>
      <ul class="small-block-grid-3">
        <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8704.PNG" class="border" alt=""/></li>
        <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8706.PNG" class="border" alt=""/></li>
        <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8707.PNG" class="border" alt=""/></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The app launches right to this screen, where a user can just start punching in numbers. The hundredths don't show up until the user taps a decimal points; even then .00 is grayed out. The number text size scales down accordingly with more digits—the original text size started large because a standard quick transaction most likely doesn't exceed 2 figures. If more than 5 digits are input, the number would just shake to visually indicate the error. </p>
      <p>This simple screen emphasizes the <strong>quick and easy</strong> payment experience that Square Cash promotes: "<em>Exchange money quickly, easily, and for free</em>". Both visual and animation designs lend themselves to the user experience. </p>
      <p>The same seamless experience continues beyond the mobile app screen. A user can have a vanity web page to receive payment from non-users.  This responsive web page works on both desktop and mobile:</p>
      <p><img src="img/ux_samples/cash_page.png" class="border" alt=""/></p>
      <p>What makes Square Cash great is more than these simple screens. For example, users get notified immediately when a transaction occurs, and can even confirm the pending transaction in their own bank accounts. This gives the user a sense of <strong>control and security</strong>, which is essential to the user experience of a financial service.</p>
      <p>A note on Venmo: [ <a href="javascript:void()" class="expand">Expand to read more</a> ]</p>
      <div id="venmo" class="hidden">
        <p><a href="https://venmo.com" target="_blank">Venmo</a> is a free digital wallet that lets you make and share payments with friends. The service's tag line is "<em>Send money instantly, for free.</em>" Here are the screens leading to the payment step:</p>
        <ul class="small-block-grid-3">
          <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8726.PNG" class="border" alt=""/></li>
          <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8727.PNG" class="border" alt=""/></li>
          <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8728.PNG" class="border" alt=""/></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Venmo has a different approach to mobile payment—it is inherently <em>social</em>, so the main screen displays a social timeline first. This helps with user recruitment, engagement, and retention, but does not necessarily make for a good payment experience (compared to Square Cash).</p>
        <p>The action flow is more intuitive than Square Cash as the user selects a recipient's name first, which is more conventional (e.g., email, messaging, etc.). However, this can either put stress on the user's cognitive load by requiring her to memorize the $ amount to input <em>after</em> searching for a recipient, or delay the action by requiring her to confirm the $ amount with the recipient. In contrast, Square Cash takes the $ amount off of the user's working memory from the first screen.</p>

      <h3>MoodNotes - Mood Input</h3>
      <p><a href="http://moodnotes.thriveport.com" target="_blank">MoodNotes</a> is a health journal app to capture and track mood patterns for thinking habit improvement via cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). To add a current mood, the user is presented with this screen:</p>
      <ul class="small-block-grid-3">
        <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8701.PNG" alt=""/></li>
        <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8702.PNG" alt=""/></li>
        <li><img src="img/ux_samples/IMG_8703.PNG" alt=""/></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>That's it. There is no repetitive questionnaire to fill out as expected of the therapy process—no "rank your mood in a scale of 1 to 7". The user simply swipes up or down the screen to change the curvature and direction of the "mouth" to indicate a mood. These expressions are universally understood and relatable. The background color changes from the neutral blue to more saturated green or yellow for a positive mood, and dark blue or desaturated gray for a negative mood, reinforcing the selection by the user. </p>
      <p>More questions appear later in the process, in a very short and digestible format, one-by-one as to not be overwhelming. Everything is optional and the user can always save and quit the entry at any step.</p>
      <p>The overall user experience strives to give the <strong>least hindrance to data input</strong>. A depressed user might already feel too unmotivated to do anything, let alone going through a complex process of logging their mood. The simplicity of MoodNotes lowers this barrier, encouraging logging and follow-through with CBT.</p><br><hr><br><p class="text-center">Would you like to visit <a href="index.html">my portfolio</a>?</p>
